Oblivion Nexus: A Research Facility Beyond the Known World

The Setting:

Deep beneath an uncharted stretch of the Earth's crust lies Oblivion Nexus, a research
facility shrouded in secrecy. Cut off from the outside world, it operates entirely off-grid,
powered by a sophisticated geothermal network that ensures its self-sufficiency. 
Officially, it doesn't exist—no records, no satellite signatures, nothing to prove it was ever built.

Within its fortified walls, brilliant minds push the limits of quantum communication and 
encryption, chasing breakthroughs that could redefine the fabric of technology itself. But 
discovery always comes at a price. The deeper they delve into the unknown, the more the 
lines between innovation and danger begin to blur.

Recently, whispers have begun to spread through the corridors—strange occurrences in 
the data, encrypted streams that appear without an origin, anomalies in experiments that 
defy established laws of physics. Some believe it's interference, a breach in the security of 
the compound. But that should be impossible. Nothing gets in. Nothing gets out.

Or at least, that's what they've always believed.

Now, as researchers return to their stations, staring at screens filled with numbers that 
refuse to make sense, a single question lingers in the back of their minds: 
Has something found a way in? 
Or did it awaken from within?


One scientist. One final encrypted message. Moments later, he's gone—erased 
from existence. The only trace left behind? A scrambled audio file filled with 
strange distortions, as if reality itself glitched for a moment before swallowing him whole.
