Congratulations! You correctly identified Dr. Naomi Vexler as the culprit.

Dr. Vexler was obsessed with the victim's work on quantum encryption. When he refused to collaborate, she tampered with his experiment, causing the accidental quantum entanglement incident that erased him from existence. She then tried to cover her tracks using her cryptographic expertise.

Your sharp detective skills have brought justice to the Oblivion Nexus facility. The authorities have taken Dr. Vexler into custody, and the research can continue under proper supervision.

Unfortunately, you accused the wrong person. The real culprit remains at large.

Without sufficient evidence to make a correct accusation, the case remains unsolved. The Oblivion Nexus facility continues to operate under a cloud of suspicion, and the mystery of the disappeared scientist may never be solved.

The real culprit continues their work in secret, and the facility remains vulnerable to further incidents.
