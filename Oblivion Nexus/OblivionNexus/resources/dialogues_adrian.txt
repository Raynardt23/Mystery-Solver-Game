I was reviewing security footage during the time of the incident.
The system did show a brief anomaly, but it was automatically corrected.
Nothing gets past my security, I assure you.
I've served in more dangerous places than this facility.
The victim seemed preoccupied lately, but wouldn't share why.
Our security protocols are the most advanced in the world.
If there was a breach, I would know about it.
